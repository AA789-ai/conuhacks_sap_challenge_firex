# Wildfire Resource Deployer & Predictor

A comprehensive application for analyzing wildfire data, tracking operational efficiency, visualizing key statistics, and predicting potential wildfire events through an interactive dashboard.

## Features

- üî• **Upload Wildfire Data**: Easily upload CSV files to analyze wildfire incidents and severity levels
- üìä **Visualize Key Statistics**: View detailed charts on fires addressed, operational costs, and damage estimates
- üìç **Predict Future Wildfires**: Get forecasts of wildfire risks based on weather and historical data

## Project Overview

This application consists of a Next.js frontend and Flask backend that work together to process, analyze, and visualize wildfire data. The system has two main components:

1. **Resource Deployer**: Analyzes historical wildfire data to optimize resource allocation and calculate efficiency metrics

## Technical Architecture

### Backend System

#### Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) System

The backend implements the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) System, a globally recognized methodology for assessing wildfire risk based on weather conditions. The system calculates several indices:

1. **Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)**: Represents moisture content of fine fuels and indicates ease of ignition
2. **Duff Moisture Code (DMC)**: Represents moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers
3. **Drought Code (DC)**: Represents deep soil moisture and seasonal drought effects
4. **Initial Spread Index (ISI)**: Combines wind and FFMC to estimate fire spread rate
5. **Buildup Index (BUI)**: Combines DMC and DC to estimate available fuel
6. **Fire Weather Index (FWI)**: Combines ISI and BUI to give overall fire intensity
7. **Daily Severity Rating (DSR)**: A transformed version of FWI used for daily fire danger

The implementation follows Van Wagner's 1987 equations with vectorized calculations for efficiency.

#### Feature Engineering

When the system processes environmental data:

1. Data is first sorted chronologically 
2. FWI components are calculated sequentially, as they depend on previous day values
3. Initial values are set (FFMC: 85.0, DMC: 6.0, DC: 15.0) as starting points
4. The system calculates all indices using temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and month
5. Additional features like vegetation indices and human activity are incorporated when available

#### Machine Learning Model

The system uses XGBoost classifier with the following characteristics:

- **Features**: Environmental data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation) and all FWI components
- **Training**: Uses chronological split (60% train, 40% test) to preserve temporal patterns and avoid data leaks
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Uses `scale_pos_weight` parameter to account for rare wildfire events
- **Hyperparameters**: Tuned for wildfire prediction with learning rate of 0.001, 2000 trees, max depth of 6

#### Backend Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: Environmental data is processed and enriched with FWI features
2. **Model Loading**: Pre-trained XGBoost model is loaded from the `/models` directory
3. **Prediction Generation**: Model produces probability scores for wildfire risk
4. **API Response**: Predictions are formatted with location, time, and risk factors

### Resource Deployment System

The Resource Deployer module handles wildfire event processing and resource allocation:

1. **Resource Pool**: Manages available firefighting resources (smoke jumpers, helicopters, etc.)
2. **Event Prioritization**: Sorts events by timestamp and severity to handle most urgent cases first
3. **Resource Assignment**: Allocates cheapest available resource to each fire event
4. **Cost Tracking**: Calculates operational costs for deployed resources and damage costs for missed responses
5. **Performance Analysis**: Generates statistics on response rates by severity level

## Project Structure

### Backend Components

- **Flask API** (`app.py`): Main entry point serving two routes:
  - `/api/p1/get_final_report`: Processes historical wildfire data and generates statistics
  - `/api/p2/get_predictions`: Generates wildfire predictions based on environmental data
